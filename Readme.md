# 🚆 RailRoute: Real-Time Train Tracking App  
## Project Plan Document

---

## 1. Problem Statement & Solution Overview

### **Problem Statement**  
Millions of local trains in India run late every day. Commuters rarely receive accurate real-time delay information, platform changes, or rerouting options. This results in missed connections, wasted time, and stress during peak hours. Existing solutions are often inaccurate, delayed, or not designed for mobile-first usage.

### **Solution Overview**  
Our proposed Flutter + Firebase mobile application offers:

- Real-time train delay updates fetched from a free Indian Railways API  
- Platform alerts and ETA predictions  
- Smart alternate route suggestions  
- User-personalized features like saved/favorite routes  
- Fast and commuter-friendly UI designed for quick access  

Firebase ensures real-time data synchronization and scalable backend support, while Flutter provides consistent performance on both Android and iOS.

## Sprint 2 – Widget Tree & Reactive UI Implementation (Today’s Progress)

### Overview
As part of Sprint 2, the focus for today was to understand and implement Flutter’s
**widget tree structure** and **reactive UI model** within the RailRoute application.
A simple interactive UI was used to demonstrate how Flutter rebuilds widgets in
response to state changes.

---

### What Was Implemented

- Identified a core screen in the RailRoute Flutter app to demonstrate widget hierarchy
- Structured the UI using nested widgets such as `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `Center`, and `Column`
- Converted the screen into a `StatefulWidget` to support dynamic UI updates
- Added a state variable to represent changing UI data
- Implemented a button that updates state using `setState()`
- Observed automatic UI updates without manually refreshing the screen

---

### Widget Tree Structure Used

MaterialApp
┗ HomePage (StatefulWidget)
┗ Scaffold
┣ AppBar
┗ Body
┗ Center
┗ Column
┣ Text
┗ ElevatedButton

yaml
Copy code

This hierarchy demonstrates how Flutter organizes UI elements into a tree where
each widget acts as a parent or child, defining layout and structure.

---

### Reactive UI Demonstration

- A button interaction updates a state variable
- `setState()` notifies Flutter of the state change
- Flutter rebuilds only the affected widgets
- The updated state is immediately reflected in the UI

This confirms Flutter’s reactive model, where UI is automatically synchronized
with application state.

---

### Outcome
This implementation provided a clear understanding of:
- How Flutter builds UI using a widget tree
- How parent–child relationships affect layout
- How Flutter efficiently updates UI components using `setState()`

These concepts will be foundational for handling real-time Firebase updates and
dynamic train status data in upcoming sprints.
